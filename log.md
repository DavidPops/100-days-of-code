##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 2: January 5th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through my second set of Codecamp exercises, where I worked with nodejs servers for the first time. I am really enjoying the Back-End track.

**Thoughts** I continued working with a Cloud9 account, I'm getting a great hang of Node.js as well, cool right.
